## Git vs. GitHub
**1. Explain what each is**  
* Git is a version control that helps take snapshots of the code or different versions of the file.  
* Github helps store code in the cloud which makes it easier to collaborate on files and help visually track changes made to the code.  

**2. Explain the differences between the two**  
* The differences between Git and Github is that Git takes snapshots of the code and doesn't require Github, however, Github stores the codes in the "cloud" and require Git.
